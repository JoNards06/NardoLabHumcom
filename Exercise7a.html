    After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins due to the efforts of the Mad Titan, Thanos. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers must assemble once more in order to undo Thanos's actions and undo the chaos to the universe, no matter what consequences may be in store, and no matter who they face...

    <p>Set in South Korea's fictional Silicon Valley called Sandbox, Start-Up tells the story of people in the world of startup companies.

        Seo Dal-mi (Bae Suzy) is a bright and ambitious young woman who dreams of starting her own company just like her father tried to. Growing up, she was separated from her mother and sister, who moved to the US with her mother's new husband. Dal-mi's father was killed in an accident not long after, and she was raised by her grandmother. Her grandmother strives to comfort her by finding a pen-pal named Han Ji-pyeong (Kim Seon-ho). However, he does not use his real name, borrowing the name Nam Do-san instead.
        
        Nam Do-san (Nam Joo-hyuk) is the founder of Samsan Tech, along with his two best friends, Lee Chul-san and Kim Yong-san. The company is on the brink of losing their parents' investment. Dal-mi and Do-san meet for the first time at a competition sponsored by Sandbox and decide to become business partners.

        <br>
        <p>Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

         Set in a fantasy world, mankind is driven to the brink of extinction by mindless, man-eating giants known as Titans. In defense, all of humanity retreated to a civilisation contained within three concentric 50-meter Walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina. In the year 845, after nearly a century of relative peace within the walls, a 60-meter "Colossal" Titan materialised at and destroyed the outermost gate, ushering in hoards of smaller Titans. Witnessing the fullness of the Titan horror first-hand, a young and tenacious Eren Jaeger vows to rid the world of all Titans and win back freedom for mankind. He is joined by his adoptive sister, Mikasa Ackerman and their friend, Armin Arlert as they set out to fulfill this shared dream.</p>

<p>The Teiko Junior High basketball team rose to distinction by demolishing basketball teams within Japan, winning the junior high Nationals for three consecutive years. The all-star players of the team became known as the Generation of Miracles. After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, a fact known to few is that there was another player in the "Generation of Miracles": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the "Generation of Miracles", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of middle school in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan and begin taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, and Seijuro Akashi.

    Seirin High team fought Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami skills with added strength and speed, Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. They then met Shintaro Midorima in the preliminaries of Interhigh. The game was much more difficult, not only because Midorima and the last three members of "Generation of Miracles" are considerably stronger than Ryota Kise, but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. They managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, whose basketball team contained the Ace of the "Generation of Miracles" - Daiki Aomine. After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team. They spent the entire summer training for the Winter Cup, even coincidentally meeting Shutoku while training.
    
    In the preliminaries, they met team Shutoku again. This match ended into a tie, so Seirin needed to defeat team Kirisaki Daichi. Kirisaki Daichi's captain was Makoto Hanamiya, a member of the Uncrowned Kings well-known for his underhanded methods to win a match. However, they won and gained a ticket to the Winter Cup.</p>
