A number of different methods have been developed to improve the performance of networking devices, both by increasing packet-forwarding speed and by decreasing packet delay through a device. <br>
Some higher-level methods focus on decreasing the amount of time needed for the routing process to converge; for example, by optimizing the timers used with the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol or the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).<br>
Optimizations are also possible at lower levels, such as by optimizing how a device switches packets, or how processes are handled. <br>
This article focuses at this lower level, specifically by examining how vendors can decrease forwarding time through the development and implementation of optimized packet-switching methods.<br>

Cisco NX-OS Software Architecture<br>
Cisco NX-OS is designed to meet the needs of modern data centers, which demand products, applications, and services that are high performance, highly available, resilient, secure, scalable, and modular in architecture.<br> 
These criteria are met by all the platforms—Nexus 3000, 5000, 6000, 7000, and 9000—that support and run Cisco NX-OS. These characteristics provide the solid foundation of resilience and robustness necessary for network device OSes powering the mission-critical environment of today’s enterprise-class data centers.<br>

    Wi-Fi 6 and 5G
    First up, wireless technology – especially Wi-Fi 6 – will get into the enterprise through the employee door and through enterprise access-point refreshes. The latest smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and other manufacturers are Wi-Fi 6 enabled, and Wi-Fi 6 access points are currently shipping to businesses and consumers.<br>
    
    5G phones are not yet in wide circulation, although that will begin to change in 2020, athough mostly for consumers and towards the end of the year. Oswal wrote that Cisco projects more people will be using Wi-Fi 6 than 5G through 2020.<br>
</p>


<p>
It’s a SD-WAN world
“We are seeing a ton of momentum in the SD-WAN area as large numbers of companies need secure access to cloud applications,” Oswal said. The dispersal of connectivity – the growth of multicloud networking – will force many businesses to re-tool their networks in favor of SD-WAN technology, he said.<br>

“Meanwhile the large cloud service providers, like Amazon, Google, and  Microsoft, are connecting to networking companies – like Cisco – to forge deep partnership links between networking stacks and services,” Oswal wrote. <br> 

Oswal said he expects such partnerships will only deepen next year, and that concurs with recent analysis by Gartner. <br>
</p>

<p>
    All-inclusive multi-domain networks
In the Cisco world, blending typically siloed domains across the enterprise and cloud to the wide-area network is getting easier, and Oswal says that will continue in 2020. 
The idea is that its key software components – Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and DNA Center – now enable what Cisco calls multidomain integration, which lets customers set policies to apply uniform access controls to users, devices and applications regardless of where they connect to the network.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The network as sensor<br>
    The notion of the network being used for something more important than speeds and feeds has been talked about for a while, but the idea may be coming home to roost next year.<br>
    “Ultimately, systems will be able to remediate issues on their own, or at least file their own help-desk tickets. This becomes increasingly important as networks grow increasingly complex.”<br>
